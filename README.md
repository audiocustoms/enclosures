# OpenMANET Enclosures

This repository collects 3D-printable and off-the-shelf enclosure designs that support OpenMANET nodes and accessories.

## Available Enclosures

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Get Started](GetStarted/README.md) | Simple Snap-fit Raspberry Pi 4 + HaLow enclosure with multiple UPS/no-UPS variants and ABS/ASA print guidance. |
| [Open Field Node](OpenMPU5/README.md) | Aluminum or 3D printed field chassis that integrates a Pi 4B, Waveshare 3S UPS, and waterproof bulkhead connectors. |

## Contributing

1. Create a directory named after your enclosure.
2. Add a `README.md` describing the use case, assembly steps, and parts list (note optional vs required parts).
3. Include any supporting assets (STL files, wiring diagrams, photos) inside the same directory.

PRs that follow the structure above make it easier for others to build repeatable OpenMANET hardware.
