## Assembly Guide

The individual components required are: a [gooseneck](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0C2NDY4RJ) (12cm long, 10mm diameter internal and external threads), a [male TNC connector](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0D9LDKLXH?th=1), a [male RP-SMA connector](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B08F4SX8YJ?th=1), and 14,5cm of [RG316 coaxial cable](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B09PT81P3N?th=1).

### 1. Glue in the TNC adapter
The TNC adapter is almost a press fit into the internal thread of the gooseneck. Once it's in, it's in! Use superglue or Sikaflex to ensure a watertight seal.

### 2. Strip one end of the coaxial cable.
Strip approximately 10-12mm of insulation. Split the shielding and fold it back. Then strip approximately 1-2mm of insulation from the inner conductor and tin it with solder.

### 3. Install the RP-SMA connector

Clamp the pin of the RP-SMA connector in a soldering jig and apply a small amount of solder to the opening. Then solder the tinned center conductor of the coaxial cable to the pin. Ensure that NO solder protrudes beyond the edge of the SMA pin. Otherwise, you won't be able to insert it into the RP-SMA connector. Now, push the coaxial cable with the pin fully into the RP-SMA connector. Next, place the shielding over the end of the RP-SMA connector and slide the crimp sleeve over the shielding. Finally, use crimping pliers to crimp the sleeve onto the end of the RP-SMA connector.

### 4. Ensure cable length

Now, insert the unstripped end of the cable with the RP-SMA connector into the threaded opening. When the RP-SMA connector is flush with the threaded end, 10mm should protrude from the TNC end. If it's too little, it will be difficult to attach the TNC connector. If it's too much, it will be very difficult to press the TNC connector into the TNC adapter. The coaxial cable is very stiff!

### 5. Install the TNC connector

Once you've ensured the correct length, pull the coaxial cable with the RP-SMA connector out of the gooseneck. Strip another 10-12 mm of insulation. Again, open the shielding (this time don't fold it back), strip 1-2 mm of insulation from the center conductor, and apply a small amount of solder. Now, push the coaxial cable back into the gooseneck and attach the crimp sleeve. Push it slightly into the TNC adapter, but still enough to remove it later. Now, apply a small amount of solder to the center conductor of the TNC connector. Be careful: DO NOT create a connection between the center conductor and the connector housing! Otherwise, you'll create a short circuit. Now, insert the center conductor of the coaxial cable far enough into the TNC connector so that you can solder them together. Now would be a good time to use a multimeter to test whether the TNC housing is making contact with the center conductor. If there's a short circuit, you'll need to reopen the solder joint and fix it. If not, you can proceed. Now, place the shielding on the end of the TNC connector, slide the crimp sleeve over it, and crimp it at the thin end.

### 6. Glue in the TNC connector

Apply glue to the inside of the TNC adapter and the thick part of the crimp sleeve. Then press the TNC connector firmly into the TNC adapter.

### 7. Mount and glue in the RP-SMA connector

Now slide the RP-SMA adapter over the RP-SMA connector so that the connector protrudes slightly from the adapter. Apply glue to the external thread of the gooseneck and press the RP-SMA adapter firmly onto the external thread of the gooseneck. Then screw the RP-SMA connector in place.

### 8. Final assembly

Now you can screw your antenna onto the RP-SMA connector. Once that's done, glue the cap to the tube, and then screw the tube onto the RP-SMA adapter.
