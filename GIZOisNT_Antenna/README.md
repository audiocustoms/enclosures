# The GIZOisNT Tactical Gooseneck Antenna
### What the heck is this?
The "GIZOisNT" antenna isn't an antenna in the traditional sense. It's more of a protective housing for various types of antennas. The GIZOisNT is a platform for mounting different antennas (WiFi, LoRa, HaLow, etc.) in the style of tactical antennas, such as those found on the Persistent Systems MPU5 or Silvus StreamCaster. GIZONT, ​​on AliExpress, is probably the best-known manufacturer of mockup antennas.

### Why should I build my own antennas?
The original antennas for tactical digital radios can cost up to 300 EUR/USD, if they're even available. Even then, there's no guarantee they'll be suitable for your project. Of course, you could look for suitable mockups on AliExpress, which are available for 25-35 EUR/USD, but with considerable waiting times.

Or: you could order the individual parts from Amazon (1-2 day delivery), take some time for 3D printing those files, and build the perfect antenna for your project at home for under 15 EUR/USD each (incl. the actual antenna).

### What do I need?
The list of required parts and tools is quite manageable. You'll need a soldering iron (fine tip) and solder. Wire strippers, side cutters, and crimping pliers. And of course, you'll need a 3D printer. The individual components required are: a [gooseneck](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0C2NDY4RJ) (12cm long, 10mm diameter internal and external threads), a [male TNC connector](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0D9LDKLXH?th=1), a [male RP-SMA connector](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B08F4SX8YJ?th=1), and [RG316 coaxial cable](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B09PT81P3N?th=1). Last but not least, you'll need the appropriate antenna. Since I built this antenna for a different project, I'm using a [2.4/5GHz antenna](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B06XB92KNF). Regardless of which antenna you ultimately install in the GIZOisNT, the connector must be RP-SMA, and the antenna diameter must not exceed 13mm. Three tubes are available in different lengths: 100mm, 150mm, and 200mm.

### Where do I start?
It's very simple: first, you download the necessary print files. You can find a list of the individual parts [here](<model files/content.md>). You can either experiment with your own printer settings or use [my presets](<printer files/printer_settings.md>). If you're using an Anycubic Kobra S1, you can directly process the included 3MF file. However, if you're using the Orca, Prusa, or Bambu slicer, you can load the 3MF file, but you may need to make some adjustments.

I suggest you print the individual parts in two batches: first the small parts, and then the tube. The tube takes a very long time to print, so you can start working on the small parts in the meantime. Even if you plan to build multiple GIZOisNTs, print the small parts first, then the tubes.

### What's next?
Once your parts are printed, follow my [assembly guide](img/assembly/assembly.md).
